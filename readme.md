This project is made using Javascript and Angularjs
The loading of the data is done in three ways laoding the data to an array manually or through loading the file using a file loading or from a server using an AJAX call
the calculation of the distance is done without taking the map in consideration but getting a more efficient measure of distance can be acheived using google maps api

to run the project just open the index file.
